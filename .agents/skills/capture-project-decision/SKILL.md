description: Capture an accepted tenkai-console design or project outcome in the smallest durable artifact. Use after a Discussion, Issue, or PR resolves a choice that may require an ADR, maintained documentation, example, or reusable Skill.

# Capture Project Decision

Promote the durable result, not the conversation that produced it.

## Procedure

1. Read the complete source Discussion, Issue, PR, and relevant current docs or
   code. Confirm the choice is accepted rather than merely proposed. Complete
   when the decision, owner, alternatives, and supporting evidence are named.
2. Select exactly the artifacts justified by future use:
   - ADR: a durable boundary, trust model, public contract, persistence
     strategy, or difficult-to-reverse technical choice;
   - documentation: repeated operator, integrator, or contributor knowledge;
   - example: a supported path is best taught and tested as executable code;
   - Skill: a repeated project-specific AI procedure or high-risk checklist;
   - none: the outcome is local to the closed work item.
   Complete when every artifact has a future audience and owner.
3. Preserve one source of truth. Link to code/protocols rather than duplicating
   exhaustive details. Put rationale in the ADR and usage in docs. Complete when
   the same rule is not maintained in multiple prose locations.
4. Console ADRs live in Tenkai's `docs/decisions/` (ADR 0031 records the web
   console). Propose a new Tenkai ADR there, allocating the next number from
   its index and following its structure, rather than starting a second
   decision log in this repository. Supersede by adding a new ADR and
   cross-linking both; retain historical text. Complete when status and
   relationships are explicit.
5. Check links, examples, Skill metadata, and affected indexes. Complete when a
   future contributor can discover the result without the original prompt.

## Output

State the selected artifact(s), why each is durable, files changed or proposed,
source links, owner, and validation. If no promotion is warranted, say so and
leave the knowledge in the closed Issue/PR.

Do not turn unresolved debate into policy, copy investigation logs into docs,
or create an ADR for routine implementation detail.
